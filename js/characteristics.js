    about: 'Of all characteristics, age is one of the greatest predictors of migration. NYC consistently attracts large numbers of people in their 20s, and generally sees net migration losses of people in all other age groups. This is tied to the lifecycle of migration, whereby young single people move to the city, and leave after family formation.',

    about: 'Sex is weakly correlated with migration. Historically, males and females are generally equally likely to move in or out of the city. However, between 2010 and 2014 NYC experienced a net gain of 44,000 more women than men due to migration.',

    about: 'Migration by race and Hispanic origin groups is closely tied to national socioeconomic trends. During the city&apos;s fiscal crisis in the late 70s and through 1990, out-migration was high for most groups, particularly whites. Asian immigration played a significant role in stabilizing population losses during this time and has been the only group to see net positive migration for all periods since 1975.',

    about: 'Nativity of migrants reflects the significance of immigration to NYC. Through all periods where data is available, NYC saw large net gains of the foreign born population, while experiencing a net loss of native born persons. This illustrates NYC&apos;s historic role in providing a landing place for newcomers to the US and in turn sending native born people to the rest of the country.',

    about: 'Lifecycle migration is particularly evident through marital status data, which is highly correlated with age. Through all periods measured, NYC attracts large amounts of people who have never been married, and in turn sees many married people leave. 2010-14 is the first period in our data showing net migration close to zero of married people however, indicating that families may be seeing the city differently than in the past. People who are married but with an absent spouse are often immigrants bring family over in stages, and therefore show net positive migration.',

    about: 'Since 1975, migration flows to and from NYC have favored the undereducated as well as the highly educated, whereas high school graduates and those with some college see the greatest losses. This continues to be true today, and is a reflection of the city&apos;s bifurcated economy, dominated by large numbers of skilled professionals as well as low skill workers who are often immigrants.',
